2:	In desired dataset folder (volcano or pulsar) create folder named "data"
3:	Download desired data from appropriate location, unzip any .tar.gz files and put all .csv files directly into respective created "data" folder:
		Pulsar: https://www.kaggle.com/pavanraj159/predicting-a-pulsar-star
		Volcano: https://www.kaggle.com/fmena14/volcanoesvenus
4:	In desired dataset/method (.py file) uncomment the intuitive functions in main to see resulting plots/metrics.
